# Plugin Upload Instructions - IMPORTANT

## Issue Resolved: Missing Dashboard Files

You're getting the "Dashboard files are missing" error because WordPress may not have extracted the ZIP file properly or there's a file permission issue.

## SOLUTION: Use the Debug Version First

### Step 1: Download the Debug Version
**File**: `backstage-access-plugin-debug.zip` (35,671 bytes)
**Location**: `C:\Users\adamb\Desktop\backstage-access-plugin-debug.zip`

### Step 2: Upload and Test
1. **Deactivate** the current Backstage Access plugin
2. **Delete** the current plugin (to ensure clean installation)
3. **Upload** `backstage-access-plugin-debug.zip`
4. **Activate** the plugin
5. **Check the error message** - it will now show you exactly which files are missing and their paths

### Step 3: Based on Debug Results

#### If Files Still Missing:
- Use **Manual Upload Method** (see below)

#### If Files Found:
- Switch to the regular version: `backstage-access-plugin-fixed-v2.zip`

## Manual Upload Method (Recommended)

### If WordPress Upload Fails:

1. **Extract** `backstage-access-plugin-fixed-v2.zip` on your computer
2. **Upload via FTP/cPanel** to: `/wp-content/plugins/backstage-access/`
3. **Ensure this structure**:
   ```
   /wp-content/plugins/backstage-access/
   ├── backstage-access.php
   ├── includes/
   │   ├── class-dashboard.php
   │   └── class-content-manager.php
   ├── assets/
   │   ├── css/
   │   └── js/
   └── templates/
   ```
4. **Activate** the plugin in WordPress admin
